```

## Contributing
Bootstrap is loaded through through npm and webpack. Run the following command to install the required dependencies.

```
npm i
```

## Compiling
Once the dependencies have been resolved, compiling the source code is simple:

```
npm run watch
```

the `watch` script will tell webpack to compile and watch for any future changes to the code base.

## Utilities
